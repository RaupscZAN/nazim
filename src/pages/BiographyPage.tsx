            <p className="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              During his twenty-year tenure at Harvard University, Dr. Ali spearheaded several groundbreaking initiatives that continue to 
              shape the field of Islamic finance. These include the Harvard University Forum on Islamic Finance, now in its twenty-seventh 
              year under his leadership; the Islamic Finance Databank, one of the earliest structured digital repositories in the field; and 
              long-standing collaborative workshops with the London School of Economics (LSE) and SOAS University of London, which continue 
              under his direction from HBKU and have now completed their twentieth year. In both academic and advisory capacities, Dr. Ali 
              engaged directly with global institutions such as the United States Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
              New York, various central banks, and other regulatory authorities. These engagements, especially in the aftermath of September 11, 
              were instrumental in advancing policy-level understanding of Islamic finance.
